# hardhat-tutorial

This is a basic boiler plate code I've written following the hardhat tutorial on the official documentation. 
https://hardhat.org/tutorial

I've commented a lot of lines of codes to the best of my knowledge, if you feel there needs to be any changes.. please PR

I'll be updating and using this repo for testing and deploying my solidity code .. which I'm currently learning

### Learning Solidity
- In the brance Introduction-to-Solidity, we'll go through the basics and understand the flow of solidity

* npx hardhat test
* npx hardhat compile
* npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js  // for test network
* npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>

- dont worry about the artifacts and cache folder, they are created on compiling your solidity code.

Happy Hacking :)
