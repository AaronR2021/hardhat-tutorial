###  Ether and Wei in simple terms
Ether and Wei are both units of measurement for the cryptocurrency Ethereum. Ether is the main currency of the Ethereum blockchain, while Wei is the smallest unit of measurement in the Ethereum system.

Think of Ether like a dollar bill, and Wei like a penny. Just as there are 100 pennies in a dollar, there are 10^18 Wei in one Ether. That means that 1 Ether is equal to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei.

When sending or receiving Ether on the Ethereum blockchain, the transaction amount is always measured in Ether. However, when working with smart contracts or interacting with the Ethereum blockchain programmatically, transactions may be measured in Wei.

For example, if you wanted to send 0.5 Ether to someone, you would send 500,000,000,000,000,000 Wei. Alternatively, if you received 1,000,000 Wei from a smart contract, you would have received 0.000000000000001 Ether.

Understanding Ether and Wei is important when working with Ethereum because it allows you to accurately measure and transfer value on the blockchain.
